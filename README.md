# data-scrape
The project tracks the most active stocks on a real time basis from CNN Moneyâ€™s Market Movers website (https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ ). Firstly, it collects the list of most actives, gainers and losers from the above website. Next, the program takes the ticker symbols and name of the companies and build a csv file (called stocks.csv). 
Further, it asks user to enter a ticker symbol. Lastly, it'll display the data about stock of the company with selected ticker symbol from the website: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD?p=AMD&.tsrc=fin-srch-v1.
